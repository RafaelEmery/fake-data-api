### About

The original objetive is having a simple application to study about REST APIs and Deploying. Now, whoever needs can consume it in other applications and have a faster development by generating fake data.

Personally, i use it in Laravel and Javascript projects for testing functions, packages and front end desingn. In the Laravel projects, i don't have to worry about coding a full CRUD just for testing some features!

### Technologies
- [X] Laravel 7
- [X] Bootstrap 4 
- [X] PostgreSQL
- [X] Heroku

## Documentation (pt-BR)

For generating the full documentation was used the [Laravel API Documentation Generator](https://github.com/mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator) package. 

Check it out at the [Fake Data API Docs](https://rafaelemery-fake-data-api.herokuapp.com/).
