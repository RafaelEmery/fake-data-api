### :mag_right: About

The original objetive is having a simple application to study about REST APIs and Deploying. Now, whoever needs can consume it in other applications and have a faster development by generating fake data.

Personally, i use it in Laravel and Javascript projects for testing functions, packages and front end desingn. In the Laravel projects, i don't have to worry about coding a full CRUD just for testing some features!

### :hammer: Technologies

## :blue_book: Documentation (pt-BR)

For generating the full documentation was used the [Laravel API Documentation Generator](https://github.com/mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator) package.
